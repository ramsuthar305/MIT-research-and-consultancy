#  MIT Research and Consultancy web portal
MIT Art Design and Technology University (MIT ADT University) is a place
where creativity and innovation coexist. The PhD course in MIT ADT University
is one amongst the enhanced courses in MIT. The Work Flow in this course is
totally based on paper work and is time consuming. The Aim of this project
is to bring Digital Transformation in this PhD Course and seize redundant free
management, digital process control and optimization, collecting and distributing
knowledge and information, and optimal coordination with existing systems for
efficient process management. This project will provide all the users a broad array
of information on a specific domain, arranged in a way that is most convenient
to access. It will increase communication and knowledge sharing. It will create
a generalized portal for all domains. The project aims to provide a rich space to
share and search information.

## Problem Statement

To develop a System that will provide an interactive platform for the Research
Scholars, research Supervisors, Research Co-Supervisors and reduce a lot of time,
efforts and paperwork, and also provide a forum for doubt solving. More specif-
ically, to allow a user to manage and communicate with other users and pub-
lish/assess articles. To facilitate submissions by making them online and avoiding
the manual paperwork submission. The system also contains a relational database
containing a list of Research Scholars, Research Supervisors and Research Co-
Supervisors, and Articles/Publishingâ€™s.
